# Google PlayStore Analysis

>Hi everyone! In this opportunity, we will be using Python, Pandas and Seaborn to analyze [Google PlayStore Apps dataset](https://github.com/mcyaputra/Files/blob/main/googleplaystore.csv)

This is a simple data exploration and analysis using python, suitable for new starters who are learning python to explore datasets, you are welcome to follow along to practice basic Python skill in:
1. Exploring dataset
2. Cleaning and preparing dataset
3. Visualizing data to understand and identify patterns in the dataset

There are 2 files in this repository:

1. [Python notebook](/data_analysis.ipynb) containing steps and codes used to explore the dataset
2. [Project report](/project_report.pdf) pdf file containing: 

-Summary of the dataset

-Business question

-Details and explanation of data exploration, cleaning, preparing and visualization phases

-Conclusion

## Steps:

1. Download [Python notebook](/data_analysis.ipynb)
2. You can run the notebook either using local machine (VScode, PyCharm etc) or using Google Colab
3. Run the code block one by one from the top, dataset will be downloaded directly from my Github page when you run the 2nd code block
4. Download the [Project report](/project_report.pdf) for more detailed explanation of each code blocks 
5. Feel free to edit/add/delete any of those steps for your own exploration
